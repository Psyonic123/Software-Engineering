# SWE-Assignment1
TEAM ALPHA BABY WOOO (team 5 of course)!!!!

In order to run this amazing project:
1. Must download the project and be able to run both Java and Python code.
2. Once downloaded, locate `DemoApplication.java` in `src/main/java/com/example/sweteamalpha/demo/`
3. Run Java on `DemoApplication.java` üî• (We usually do this using a Java debugger on Visual Studio Code).
4. This application will be put onto `localhost:8080` and you should connect to it through a browser (all testing done on chrome üòù)
5. Once on player-entry screen, enter IDs (please remember those IDs for the generator as it's not automatic üò≠)
6. Pressing enter will send you to the action screen where things go down ü§Ø
7. Now while action screen is on, go the downloaded code and run the python generator `test.py` which is located in `src/main/`. This will make you enter the IDs on each team and number of events that will occur. Make this a large number to simulate a long game where the action doesn't stop üíØ
8. This should now simulate a game using UDP sockets with the scores changing üòÑ


Note: If you want to transition from the player-screen to the action-screen, one must press the "Enter" key.
